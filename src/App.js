// This code defines the main structure of a React application that implements a study on AI-generated dating profiles.
// It uses React Router for navigation and Firebase for data storage.
// The application includes pages for consent, demographics, instructions, rating profiles, and debriefing.
// The `StudyProvider` context manages the participant's consent state across the app.
// The `RequireConsent` component ensures that participants cannot access protected pages without giving consent first.
// The app is designed to be hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages using HashRouter for URL management.
// The `App` component sets up the routing and wraps everything in the `StudyProvider` context.
// The `Routes` component defines the different pages of the study, with route guards to ensure consent is given before accessing protected pages.
// The `Navigate` component is used to redirect users to the consent page if they try to access an unknown route.
// The application is structured to guide participants through the study process, ensuring they understand their rights and the purpose of the research.
